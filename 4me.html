<p>Wildlife
    There are few  things as captivating as witnessing wild animals in their natural habitats.
     That’s one of the reasons why travel is so special – it allows us to have once-in-a-lifetime
      encounters with the amazing creatures that roam our planet. 
      From watching a cheetah sprint across the savannah to diving next to giant manta rays,
     wildlife experiences are one of the most incredible aspects of travel.</p>
     <h2> <strong> Under Threat</strong></h2>
     <p>Unfortunately, many of the iconic wildlife species that captivate us are also threatened 
         by human activities. Animal and plant species around the world
          are facing extinction at up to 1000 times the natural rate. 
          Elephants, tigers, sea turtles, and orangutans are just a few of the species that 
          are currently endangered. When one species goes extinct we not only lose that species forever,
          but it can also throw off the balance of the entire ecosystem.</p> 
          <h3>Sustainable Wildlife Tourism</h3>
          <p>Tourism activities such as safaris, birdwatching, snorkeling, and nature photography all depend
               on healthy plants and animals. As wildlife tourism becomes 
               increasingly popular, it’s important to ensure it happens in a sustainable manner.
                We believe that tourism can and should protect global biodiversity,
                 safeguard habitats, and prioritize animal welfare.
               Afterall, there won’t be much to see if the 
               plants and animals that inspire us no longer exist.</p>
